1. Be in develop branch, do HW
Create files
Render ipynb as html by running this in VScode terminal:
	jupyter nbconvert --to html your_notebook.ipynb --output your_notebook.html



2. After finishing HW, stage the changes to prepare to move to main branch
be in develop branch.
Click on "+" next to the file in "source control" to move the HW file from "changes" to "staged changes"
Type a message in the "message" box in "source control". E.g., "save HW". ***THERE MUST BE A MESSAGE, ELSE COMMIT WILL GO IN LOOP
AFTER typing a message, click blue "commit" button



3. Actually move HW from "develop" to "main" branch
Click on "..." in source control. Click "checkout to...". It'll open the top bar. Select "main".
Click on "..." in source control. Click "branch" -> "merge". It'll open the top bar. Select "develop". 
Now, it's checked out the HW file from "develop" to "main" branch. But I still need to push changes to internet.
To do that, click on "..." in sourcce control. Click "push". It should show all changes in "main" branch online.
